Dependency injection in Node.js is a pattern where, instead of creating or requiring dependencies directly inside a module, we pass them as parameters or reference.

It is a way of making a decoupled code into more declarative and modular.

Instead of using on dependency statically inside a block of function, we can pass that dependency as a parameter that makes it more modular and maintainable.
